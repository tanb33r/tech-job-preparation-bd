- Data Hiding
- Access Modifiers
- Getters and Setters

- Super Keyword
- Multiple Inheritance

#### Polymorphism
- Method Overloading
- Method Overriding
- Runtime Polymorphism
- Interface Implementation

#### Abstraction
- Abstract Classes
- Interfaces
- Abstract Methods
- Implementation Hiding

### Advanced OOP Concepts
- Static Members
- Virtual Functions
- Design Patterns
- SOLID Principles

### Language-Specific Implementation
- Java OOP
- C++ OOP
- Python OOP
- JavaScript OOP

### Practice Problems
- Class Design Challenges
- Inheritance Hierarchies
- Polymorphism Examples
- Design Pattern Implementation
