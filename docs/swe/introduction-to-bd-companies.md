# Introduction to BD Companies (Fresher Perspective)

When it comes to hiring fresh graduates in Bangladesh, companies generally fall into three categories:

1. **Competitive Programming-Oriented**  
   _(Examples: Enosis Solutions, Brain Station 23)_
2. **Development Experience-Oriented**  
   _(Mostly smaller companies)_
3. **Mix of Both**  
   _(But with more emphasis on competitive programming)_

## Competitive Programming-Oriented

- Your **Codeforces rating** doesn't matter much.  
- **Participation or achievements** in **ICPC** or **IUPC** are good additions to your resume.  
- Expect **programming contests** or **problem-solving rounds** (either live or via platforms like HackerRank) as the first step.  

## Development Experience-Oriented

- Focuses more on **practical development skills** than competitive programming background.  
- Your **portfolio, GitHub projects, and internships** matter more.  
- Good to master **popular technologies** like React/Angular, Node.js, Django, .NET, Java Springboot.
- The process usually involves **technical interviews** and **small development tasks** rather than problem solving rounds.

I've seen Laravel stack has lower salary than other stacks on average, so I'll suggest to avoid that.

## Mixed Approach

- Combines both styles, but still **gives more weight** to competitive programming.  
- You might face **both** a problem-solving round and a small development task.

### Process
1. **Problem-Solving Round/Contest**  
1. **Technical Round (Coding, OOP, Database, Operating System, etc)**  
2. **HR Round**  

During the HR round, they often try to figure out **how long you plan to stay** with them.  
Common question:  
> "Do you have plans to go for higher studies?"

**Rule #1:** Do **NOT** say “Yes.”  
Even if you do plan to go abroad, don’t disclose it. Many companies take it negatively.  

Instead, say something like:  
- *“I want to build my career in Bangladesh because of the opportunities and work culture here.”*  
- *“I need to stay in Bangladesh for family reasons.”*



## Technical Round
- Some companies ask theoritical questions in technical 

## Advice for Freshers

- Choose a company prioritizing more on **culture and learning opportunities**, even if the salary isn’t great at first.
- As a fresher, you have **low leverage** — meaning you need the company more than they need you.  
- Once you start working, you’ll gain **experience and credibility**, giving you more leverage for better opportunities later, and keep appying at other places.

Getting your first job is about entering the industry. Improving your position comes after.
