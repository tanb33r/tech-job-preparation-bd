# Interview Tips

Most interviews are coducted in English (partially/fully)
English speaking is important specially if the company is client based.
So practice introduction and your project discussion so you dont get nervous during the interview.

Some questions are common and are asked in almost all interviews.
- Introduce yourself.
- Why do you want to work here?
- Why are you leaving your current job?
- What is your future plan?

Prepare self introduction, do so within 1 minute.
You will try to showcase your capability here, so mention compentitive programming if you were active in that.
Or some projects you take pride on.
Then move on to industry experiece if you have any.
Talk about some projects you were involved with, dont discuss in detail.

Again this should be within 1 minute.

You dont have to dress ultra fromal but semi-formal is necessary.

If it's online interview, be semi-formal, and make sure your are clearly.
Bad internet connection is a big no no. It'll effect the interview experiece for the interviewer as well, so have mobile data as backup.
Use backgroud filter so that your background is not visible.
